# User Storage Backend

This is a fully functional backend user storage and profile service.

## Instructions for Build and Use

1. Download all necessary files
2. Install all necessary dependencies
3. Create a .env file with the necessary login and config credentials
4. Ensure all database tables and columns are created
5. Start the backend server using Uvicorn and FastAPI
6. Backend endpoints are available for use on your server!

## Instructions for using the software:

Use the endpoints just like you would use any other http endpoints. The built in frontend provides a basic use case for the backend system, but you are free to create your own!
